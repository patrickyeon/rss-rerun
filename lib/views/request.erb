<h2>Request a new feed</h2>

Seeing as this is all pretty early stage right now, we don't quite have enough
faith in the auto-generated historical feeds to just let our code run amok. If
you'd like to point us at a specific feed you'd like to have re-runs of, let us
know here and we'll tell you when it's happened and been approved by one of our
people.

<form action="/magic_req" method="GET">
    Feed: <input type="text" name="request_url" value="<%= feed_url %>">
    <br />
    Email: <input type="text" name="contact">
    <br/>
    <input type="checkbox" name="more_info"> Keep me up to date about rss-reruns.
    <br/>
    We like peaceful inboxes and respect yours too! 
    Unless you click that checkbox, your email address will not be used for
    <strong>anything</strong> except notifying you about this specific link.
