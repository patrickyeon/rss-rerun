<%= erb :header, :locals => {'title' => 'Not Found'} %>
The page you are looking for is not here. If you think something's broken, now is a good time time to panic. Go ahead. When you're done, contact the people in charge and I'm sure they'll fix things. Or they may just tell you why the bug you're seeing is really a feature. All the same, good luck.
<%= erb :footer %>
