<p>Wouldn't it be nice to start that podcast you just discovered from the beginning, but
also be able to catch up with it so that you can listen in realtime? Or maybe just go through
a load of old content at your own pace? Now you can!</p>

<p>Check out my new RSS rebroadcasting service! Just put in a feed URL, a date to start from,
and a rerun schedule, and wha-bam! I'll give you a whole new feed so that you can consume that
content on your own terms!</p>

<p>Why not try now, I've lined up some examples. You can also jump right in and cue up a
feed I've never heard of.</p>

<a href="rerun?url=http%3A%2F%2Fembedded.fm%2Fepisodes%3Fformat%3Drss&startDate=<%= DateTime.now - 7 %>&schedule=246">Making Embedded Systems</a>, 
originally a weekly podcast but you can catch up with episodes on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday
schedule until you've burnt through the backlog. Better get started, the reruns started
a week ago!
