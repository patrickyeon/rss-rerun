rss-rerun
=========
A web app to act as a shim in between an RSS feed and your reader. The user sets a schedule to re-broadcast the initial content, and rss-rerun will re-broadcast the feed from the start so that the user can catch up at their own pace.

Start it up with `ruby lib/app.rb` and check out `http://localhost:4567/`.

There's a rough roadmap in `TODO`.
